# quickdoc
***Who need Word or LaTex anyway?***

Just a document creation/building thingy. Like LaTex. But Simpler(-ish) and Newer! (Please don't use this thing)

# quickstart
Download using ```git clone https://github.com/SomeMinecraftModder/quickdoc.git```

Build the sample document: ```python3 main.py doc.qdd```
You can now enjoy your document with QuickDoc!

# TODO
* Write test
* Add support for compiling to markdown
* Switch to class instead of function for looking more *profesional*
* Write some fancy README.MD
* Add support for image
