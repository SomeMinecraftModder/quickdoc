# quickdoc
***Who need Word or LaTex anyway?***

Just a document creation/building thingy. Like LaTex. But Simpler(-ish) and worst. (Please don't use this thing)

# quickstart
Download using ```git clone https://github.com/SomeMinecraftModder/quickdoc.git```

Build the sample document: ```python3 main.py doc.qdd```
You can now enjoy your document with QuickDoc!
